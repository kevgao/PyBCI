PyBCI
=====

This is an experimental tool for conducting motor imaginary experiments based on g.USBamp from g.tec.


1. BCI and EEG

As a recent hotspot for computer science researchers, Brain Computer Interface or BCI mainly deals with brain signal
analysis through computer science methods. By reading human minds, BCI has many promising applications in medical,
industry and common living. 

There are several approaches for BCI, such as EEG, EMG, fMRI, etc. EEG is the most common and convinient one for its low
cost and little harm.
